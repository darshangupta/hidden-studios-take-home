Tried requests library, then playwright, and playwright stealth to pull fortnite data, none worked. No other APIs (that I found) were sufficient for this exact purpose. Decided to pull data from a few maps instead, and then run statistical analysis on them to determine future forecasts. Here are the IDs: 6155-1398-4059, 4366-9611-6988, and 2744-5526-2967. 


Setup Instructions:
